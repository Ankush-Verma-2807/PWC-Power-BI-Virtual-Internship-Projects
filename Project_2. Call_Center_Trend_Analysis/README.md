# Call Center Trend Analysis

The Call Center Analysis project, developed during my PWC internship, delves into the dynamics of call centersâ€”a hub of customer interactions. Analyzing trends within these centers is crucial for optimizing operations and enhancing customer experiences. Leveraging data analytics and dashboards streamlines this process, providing actionable insights to improve efficiency and service quality.
