# Customer Churn and Customer At Risk Analysis 

The Customer Churn Analysis project, developed during my PWC internship, examines customer behavior to predict and mitigate churn. It includes a Customer at Risk Analysis, crucial for identifying potential churn candidates. This analysis is vital for businesses, enabling proactive measures to retain customers, optimize services, and sustain long-term profitability.

Although this dashboard is created from a single dataset but it consist of two reports - Churn Rate Analysis and Customer At Risk Analysis.
